I am delighted to tell that my order did arive as expected and the service was fantastic!
I got a charge on my account, Can i have my money back?
I have been trying to abort my payment, but i got still charged!
I have been a very loyal and happy customer of this fantastic company, I have also been satisfied with the customer serivce for more than 15 years, but last summer the customer serivce was not helpful.
Dear customer support, can I suspend my plan for one month?
